Task: Event Attendee Management System

You are tasked with creating a basic event attendee management system. The system should allow organizers to add new attendees, manage their names, search for attendees, and list all attendees in a formatted way.

Requirements:

Attendee Data:
Store the names of event attendees in an array. Each name should be a string.
Functionalities to Implement:

Add a new attendee:
Create a function addAttendee that takes an attendee's name as input, converts it to uppercase, and adds it to the array of attendees if it's not already in the list.

Search for an attendee:
Create a function findAttendee that takes a name as input, converts the name to uppercase, and checks if it exists in the array. If it exists, display the attendee's position in the list. If not, display a message that the attendee was not found.

Format and display all attendees:
Create a function listAttendees that formats the list of attendees into a single string, separating names by commas (,) and adds "Attendees:" at the start of the list.

Remove an attendee:
Create a function removeAttendee that takes an attendee's name, converts it to uppercase, and removes the attendee from the list if they exist.
